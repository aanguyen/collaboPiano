For 2017 IEEE Hardware Hackathon at the University of Toronto.

## Hardware used:  

- Arduino Uno (x2)
- 8ohm speaker (x2)
- FSR 400 Series Force Sensor 30-73258 (x4)
- NRF24L01 Tranceiver (x2)
- Wires and stuff (a shitton)

## Libraries used:

- [RadioHead](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/RadioHead-1.46.zip)

## Tranceiver Setup

## Notes:
- Speakers were connected to pin 3 (and grounded)
- When connecting the force sensors, ensure that they are all connected to separate grounds to prevent interference.
- Force sensor setup is the same with Arduino Uno which is what we used
